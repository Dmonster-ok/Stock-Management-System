## Conclusion

This streamlined plan outlines the approach for developing a Stock Management System within the 4-hour hackathon constraint. By focusing on completing all mandatory features first and implementing only the most impactful optional features if time permits, the project aims to meet the baseline requirements while demonstrating technical proficiency.

The plan emphasizes rapid development with the MERN stack (substituting MariaDB for MongoDB), focusing on core functionality and minimal viable features. The 3+1 hour split ensures sufficient time for both development and refinement before submission.
